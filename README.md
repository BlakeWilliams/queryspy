# QuerySpy

QuerySpy is a simple MySQL proxy written in Go that listens for, and logs queries on a per-table basis.

WARNING: SSL does not currently work with this proxy. The proxy explicitly modifies the server capabilities packet to remove SSL support. PR's adding SSL support is welcome.

## Commands

Interacting with GuessWho is done through SQL commands. For example, to dump the collected query info you can run the following query:

```sql
gw dump
```

This creates a YAML file per-table with all the collected queries. e.g. `users.yaml`:

```yaml
# This file was generated by DO NOT MODIFY
version: 1
queries:
  b2a82b217edadea3876aaca3527dd375:
    digest: select * from users where id in (?) limit ?
```


## TODO

- Detect `CLIENT_QUERY_ATTRIBUTES` and panic as it's not supported.
